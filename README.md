# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis

This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn analysis helps businesses understand why customers leave and identify patterns that can prevent future loss.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic and service usage data.
- **Dataset**: A telecom-style customer dataset with features such as contract type, tenure, monthly charges, etc.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data preprocessing & cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature engineering
  - Machine learning modeling (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
  - Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
